<h1>Learn Functional Programming with Ticking Clock</h1>
<h2>PROBLEM : Build a ticking clock</h2>
<h3>CONSIDERATIONS :</h3>
<p>
1. The clock needs to display hours, minutes,seconds, and time of day in civilian time.</p>
<p>
2. Each field must always have double digits, meaning leading zeros need to be applied to single-digit values like 1 or 2.</p>

<p>
3. The clock must also tick and change the display every second.
