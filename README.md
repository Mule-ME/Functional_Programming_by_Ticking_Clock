<h1>Learn Functional Programming with Ticking Clock</h1>
<h2>PROBLEM : Build a ticking clock</h2>
<h3>CONSIDERATIONS :</h3>
<p>
1. The clock needs to display hours, minutes,seconds, and time of day in civilian time.</p>

<p> 2. Each field must always have double digits, meaning leading zeros need to be applied to single-digit values like 1 or 2</p>

<p>
3. The clock must also tick and change the display every second.
</p>

<h3>What is Functional Programming</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions and immutable data structures as a main building block to develop predictable, maintainable, and scalable software.</p></li>
<li>
<p>It considered  as a DECLARATIVE programming paradigm,  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imperative vs   Declarative programming</h3>
<p>Both are a style of programming<p>
<h4>Imperative Programming</h4>
<p>It only concerned with HOW to achieve result with code.</p>

<h4>Declarative Programming</h4>
<p>A style of programming where applications are structured in a way that prioritize </p>

<h3>Solution : Functional programming approach to solve this problem</h3>
